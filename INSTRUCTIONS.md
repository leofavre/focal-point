# Focal Point Editor

Crop images in responsive layouts without losing what matters most.

## Steps

1. Choose an image
   - Select an image from your device. It’s kept locally, so it can be edited offline. No uploads.

2. Edit the focal point
   - Use the slider to set the mask aspect ratio and drag the image to control how it’s cropped.

3. Grab the code
   - When you’re done, copy the code to use the image in full-width banners and responsive layouts.
